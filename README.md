A TIFF Library for Rust
=======================

I needed this library to import elevation models for a routing library. As
elevation models usually come in GeoTIFF format, but no such library was
available for Rust, I created this library, taking Gavin Baker's TIFF
library as inspiration. (discontinued, it seems:
https://github.com/gavinb/rust-tiff).

The purpose of this library is to simply read GeoTIFFs, nothing else. It should
work for other TIFFs as well, I guess, but TIFFs come in many flavors, and it's
not intended to cover them all.

Library Usage

To be seen...
